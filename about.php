<ul>
  <li>The idea is to have "softcore" unoficial go rating system.</li>
  <li>Registered players can play friendly games and report them instantly.</li>
  <li>This site is not related to EGD directly, it only uses it to identify players and get their initial rating.</li>
  <li>The rating change calculation is the same as on <a href="https://www.europeangodatabase.eu/EGD/EGF_rating_system.php">EGD</a></li>
  <li>The rating change modifiers on EGD are A=100%, B=75%, C=50% and D=25%. We have 3 categories: Serious:50%, Rapid 25%, Blitz 10%</li>
  <li>People can't just register on this site, you need to be invited by someone who is already registered.</li>
</ul>

TODO:
<ul>
  <li>Update player EGD rating when processing tournaments</li>
  <li>Update our rating when tournament games are processed (for users which registered before the tournament)</li>
  <li>Process all tournaments, and then automatically check for new tournaments and apply them.</li>
  <li>Country selector</li>
  <li>Some styles</li>
  <li>Import EGD game history into our database, so we can see all games and history including tournament and non tournament games.</li>
  <li>More functionality for higher admin roles (rating change + log of it in the list of games), removal of games or users, adding sgf files to others etc.</li>
</ul>
